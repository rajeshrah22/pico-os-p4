RTOS Sample Attack
====================

This builds a very basic supervisor which a vulnerable service call which can
be used to write anywhere in memory. The supervisor has optional dynamic MPU
configuration, like the one found in Minion and uVisor.


Requirements
==============
The attack is built with the STM32F407 Discovery Board in mind. Furthermore,
you will need the arm-none-eabi-gcc toolchain. For debugging purposes, we
provide a gdbinit file to load any symbols.

Build
=======
To build the base demo, run

$ make

To build the demo with the MPU enabled, run

$ make mpu
